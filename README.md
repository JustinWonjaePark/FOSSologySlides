# FOSSology Hands-On Slides

Welcome to the small repo of FOSSology Hands-On Slides! Five slide deck presentation documents are provided:

1. An introduction slide deck which prepares attendees to have a training session including one example for a schedule
2. A slide deck which explains the motivation to use FOSSology
3. Basic workflow explains a basic run through with a component analysis as one slide deck
4. SPDX is also introduced very briefly in the fourth slide deck, because FOSSology exports and imports SPDX
5. A fifth slide deck explains acceleration features: how to be faster at analysing many components or large components.
